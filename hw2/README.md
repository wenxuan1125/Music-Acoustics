# Assignment 2 Modal synthesis

Assignment Spec:  

The idea is to make measurements from a few notes of an acoustical instrument and simulate it by synthesizing each partial separately using the measured parameters.  

1. Choose two of the Glockenspiel samples to model at any dynamic. Plot the time domain waveforms of each of these samples.  

2. Locate in the spectra the five partials having the most energy just after the attack below 15kHz, and estimate their frequencies, and the parameters of an exponential amplitude envelope fit to each one. Plot the amplitude envelopes of these overtones.    

3. Make an additive synth model of the two samples you have chosen with your results from no. 2 and write the result to an audio file. (Make sure to normalize before writing to an audio file!)  

4. Compare your syntheses with the real recording and discuss differences, problems, missing features in relation to the theory. Suggest possible improvements.
