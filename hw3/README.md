# Assignment 3 Singing synthesis

Assignment Spec:   

Make a singing synthesis model in Matlab using the source-filter method.   

1. Construct a source consisting of a number of partials in form of sinus oscillators (at least 30). Add a vibrato modulation option. Arrange the partial amplitudes so that the spectrum slope becomes -6 dB/octave. The waveform should approach a sawtooth.  
2. Make at least 5 formant filters using resonance two-pole filters.   
Control the synthesis by specifying the logarithmic frequency in MIDI note number, the formant frequencies and bandwidths in Hertz.   
3. Add a control parameter for dynamics, which control both the sound level (in dB) and the spectral slope of the source (dB/octave).   
4. Test the model by inserting the measured values from the voice lab (or measure your voice again). Make a little melody with variation in pitch and vowel. Compare the result with the natural sound. Plot the result in a spectrogram.  
5. Discuss problems, missing features in relation to the theory. Suggest possible improvements.
